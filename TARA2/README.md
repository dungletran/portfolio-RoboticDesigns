This project is done as part of the required coursework for MP4010 â€“ Mechatronics Systems Design and Analysis (Nanyang Technological University); including design, fabrication, and programming of a mechatronics system which is an autonomous tennis ball collection vehicle. The design of the vehicle was following the product design specifications. Conceptual and detailed designs are discussed with important calculations. Computer-Aided Drawings of the general assembly and individual parts are developed to provide visualization of the physical object.

Besides, the selection of several critical parts of the vehicle is done to be analyzed using finite element analysis to determine structural integrity. Last but not last, strategy and programming of the vehicle are explained in detail (refer to the report)

I was in the Programming team in this project. The code was developed in C language and executed by a microprocessor. Flowchart, function description can be found in the project report. The code is provided as well for your reference. Please refer to the file name: user_routines.c in the code folder for giving new functions to the control board.
